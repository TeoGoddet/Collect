## Editing the project
If you want to edit the project, feel free to fork it & make your changes.
If you create something that might be useful for others, please create an issue that indicates which changes you are working on.

If everyone is content with the proposal, the change will be merged into the `master` branch.

### Prerequisites
To work on this project, you need to install the [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler `tsc`. To compile the project, run `tsc` in the directory that contains `tsconfig.json`.

You can also open the `Collect.sln` file in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) if you installed the `TypeScript SDK` and the `Node.js development` workload using the Visual Studio Installer.
 
#### Installing
If you want to edit this project, you need to install it first. This can be done as described in the [installation section in the readme](README.md#installation).

In order to start the server in debug mode, start it without the `production` parameter:
```
node app
```

If you don't know where to start or need to know something, feel free to create an issue.


Happy hacking!
