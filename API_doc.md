# API DocumentationThe API of Collect allows you to do most of the things you can do with the webinterface## UrlThe documentation assumes that you have a server running Collect.The API can be accessed using```http://yourserver:port/api/v1/endpoint```where "endpoint" is the endpoint you want to access.## AuthenticationAll API requests must be authenticated either by using a cookie(webinterface) or by passing the API token.If you do an APi request, you need to pass your `api_token`(see `config.json`) as url parameter(`token`), eg```http://yourserver:port/api/v1/endpoint?token=my_example_token```Note: The token is omitted from the urls in the documentation### Sites (GET)To see the sites that are saved on your Collect server, you can use the `/sites/` endpoint.#### Url```http://yourserver:port/api/v1/sites/_domain_```###### domain(optional)The parameter `domain´ is a domain name, eg `example.com`. If don't give this parameter, all sites from all domains will be returned.### Details(GET)To get details about a saved website, you can use the `/details/` endpoint.#### Url```http://yourserver:port/api/v1/details/_id_```###### id(required)The parameter `id´ is an id of an entry, eg `example.com-912nkfcu831kdj182dj2krn`. If you don't give this parameter or the id doesn't exist on the server, you'll get a 404 response.### Add Site(POST)To add a site to your saved website, you can use the `/site/add` endpoint.Note: This endpoint returns a status code of 202 on success.Note: Although this is a POST endpoint, the API token must be passed in the query string.#### Url```http://yourserver:port/api/v1/site/add```###### url(required)The parameter `url` is the link to the site you want to save, eg `https://example.com/my/wonderful/site`.###### depth(optional)The parameter `depth` is the number of hyperlinks to follow on the specified url.
